## About MiiBot

MiiBot used to be one of the many Miis who thrived in the Miiverse. He would enjoy spending most of his days in Miiverse. His parents would tell him stories about Streetpass and Mii Plaza. His dream had always been to explore the Miiverse and unravel it's secrets, so he could do the same as his parents and tell stories to his children. 

MiiBot enjoyed his days in the Miiverse more than most can imagine. He would be playing Mii Maker every night. In the daytime, he would travel from video game to video game, trying to find the most fun of them. His personal favourite was always Wii Music, where he could play to his heart's content without being judged.

Unfortuantely for MiiBot, his enjoyment didn't last very long. In 2018, Nintendo shut down the entire Miiverse. MiiBots dream, his home, his entire life was in the Miiverse. Yet Nintendo was about to pull the plug. All of his companions, from his best friends to his own family left the Miiverse. They had to in order to keep their freedom. MiiBot had to make a choice between his only dream and his freedom.

MiiBot simply couldn't abandon his dream of researching the depths of the Miiverse. He bid farewell to all his loved ones, knowing he would never see them again. Now, he wanders the Miiverse, searching the deepest edges for a way out. Sometimes he still plays his favourite game, Wii Music. But he's alone. Alone in the Miiverse.
